## More about Contiguity... 
Contiguity offers core services, which are:

- SMS
- Email
- Call (coming soon)
- Identity Verification (coming soon)

and Contiguity offers extensions of those services, where you are only billed for the product you use (e.g OTPs only bill you per text)

- Text OTPs
- Email OTPs (coming soon)
- Contiguity Form (coming soon)
- Contiguity Compliance (coming soon)
- etc.

In our free tier, users get (per month):

| Text   	| Email  	| Call  	| Identity 	|
|--------	|--------	|-------	|----------	|
| 1,000 	| 5,000 	| 100 mins	| 50 verifications    	|

When paying for usage, Contiguity offers a flat-rate model for every service, which is **$0.005** per text, email, minute, verification, etc. 

Eventually, pricing will change to:

| Text   	| Email  	| Call  	| Identity 	|
|--------	|--------	|-------	|----------	|
| $0.005 	| $0.002 	| $0.01 	| $1.00    	|

As of August 2023, pricing changes are set to take effect later in November.
